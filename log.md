# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learnt a bit about timer functions and asynchronous Javascript

**Thoughts**: Struggled with promises in JS, but managed to figure out some basic functionality. Callback chains are definitely more difficult to handle than promise chains.

**Today's Progress**: Completed shopping 360
