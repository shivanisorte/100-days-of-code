# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learnt a bit about timer functions and asynchronous Javascript

**Thoughts**: Struggled with promises in JS, but managed to figure out some basic functionality. Callback chains are definitely more difficult to handle than promise chains.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
