# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about timer functions and asynchronous Javascript

**Thoughts**: A Callback or two is easy to handle. But callback chains are definitely more difficult to handle than promise chains. I struggled with promises in JS, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
